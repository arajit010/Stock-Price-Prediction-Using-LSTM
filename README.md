# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM

Title: ðŸš€ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM ðŸ“ˆ

Description: This project utilizes the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict future stock prices. LSTM is a powerful architecture for time series prediction tasks as it can capture long-term dependencies in data. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

Objective: To forecast future stock prices based on intraday data. By leveraging LSTM, the model aims to capture intricate patterns and trends in the data to make accurate predictions.

Key Tech Stacks:

Python: Programming language used for implementing the project.
Matplotlib: Library for creating visualizations and plots to analyze data and visualize predictions.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis, used for handling and processing the dataset.
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework utilized for building and training the LSTM model.
By combining these technologies, the project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for intraday stock price prediction, empowering users to make informed decisions in the financial markets.
